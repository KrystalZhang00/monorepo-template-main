# Use Case 3

<hr>

**Use Case**: * Drawing on Canvas*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *The primary actor aims to create artwork on the canvas within the mini-paint program.*

**Preconditions**: *The mini-paint program is running, and the user is actively working on a canvas.*

**Trigger**: *User selects a drawing tool (e.g., pencil, brush) and starts drawing.*
  
**Scenario**: *1. User launches the mini-paint program and opens a canvas.
2. User selects a drawing tool (e.g., pencil, brush) from the toolbox.
3. User positions the cursor on the canvas where they want to start drawing.
4. User clicks and holds the mouse button to draw.
5. The system records the user's mouse movements and updates the canvas in real-time.
6. User releases the mouse button to stop drawing.*
 
**Exceptions**: *If there is a sudden system error or crash during the drawing process, the user should attempt to save their work if possible. They can also restart the program and recover their work if an auto-save feature is available.*

**Priority**: *High-priority.*

**When available**: *First release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor (user) interacts with the system through the program's GUI using a pointing device (e.g., mouse) to draw on the canvas.*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *Ensure efficient rendering of drawings on the canvas, and consider implementing auto-save functionality to prevent data loss in case of unexpected errors.*
